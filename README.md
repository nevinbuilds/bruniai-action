# Visual regression testing with playwright and openai

This GitHub Action is designed to streamline visual regression testing by automatically comparing images and highlighting differences between them. Ideal for CI/CD pipelines, it helps developers catch unintended visual changes in web apps, design systems, or any UI-driven project. With easy integration and configurable thresholds, it ensures your visuals stay consistentâ€”enabling fast, automated feedback for every commit or pull request.
